Project Purpose:
The Digital Library Organizer demonstrates the use of three core computer science concepts in PHP — recursion, hash tables, and binary search trees — to simulate how a real-world library might categorize, store, and search books efficiently.

How to Run Each Part:

recursion.php — Displays book categories using recursion.

hashtable.php — Shows how book data (author, year, genre) is retrieved using associative arrays.

bst.php — Builds and searches a Binary Search Tree of book titles.

main.php (optional) — Combines all parts with a simple search interface.

Include in Repository:

recursion.php  
hashtable.php  
bst.php  
(Optional) main.php

Example Screenshots / Outputs:

Recursion output showing indented categories.

Hashtable output displaying author, year, and genre.

BST traversal and search results.
